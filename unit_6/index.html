        <h2>ASIDE</h2>
        <p>As a kid I used to rip out paper from magazines and make funky little collages that are still hanging around my parents house. Surprisingly, this developed into a major aspect of what makes my artworks unique today. Collaged paper is worked into each piece, most of the time as a background. I like the texture and mixture of color that this technique creates.

        I consider my design work to be an art form of its own, however, I took a painting course my senior year and it rekindled my interest in hands on projects. I started painting portraits for friends and family of their favorite athletes, musicians, celebrities as well as other family members. People kept asking and I kept painting. Commissioned portraits are a lot of what I do but I have been having fun exploring new mediums as well as subject matter. Itâ€™s now been almost a year and a half and I feel like I am still discovering new things and learning so much about art and its industry.</p>
